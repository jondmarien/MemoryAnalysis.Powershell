=== Memory Dump Acquisition Guide ===

To create a memory dump for testing, you have several options:

1. COMAE TOOLKIT (DumpIt) - Easiest, Free
   Download: https://www.comae.com/
   
   Usage:
   - Download and extract DumpIt
   - Run DumpIt.exe as Administrator
   - It will create a .raw file in the same directory
   
2. FTK Imager - Free, GUI-based
   Download: https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager
   
   Usage:
   - Open FTK Imager as Administrator
   - File -> Capture Memory
   - Choose destination and click "Capture Memory"
   
3. WinPmem - Free, Command-line
   Download: https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem/releases
   
   Usage:
   - Run as Administrator: winpmem_mini_x64.exe memory.raw
   
4. Task Manager (Quick test - small dump)
   - Open Task Manager as Administrator
   - Find a process (e.g., explorer.exe)
   - Right-click -> Create dump file
   - This creates a process dump (not full memory, but good for testing)

=== Creating a Test Dump with Task Manager ===

Would you like to create a quick test dump using Task Manager? (y/n)
This will create a small process dump for testing the module
"@

if ($choice -eq 'y') {
    Write-Host "`nOpening Task Manager..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Write-Host @"
    
Steps:
1. Task Manager will open
2. Go to the "Details" tab
3. Find a process (like 'explorer.exe' or 'powershell.exe')
4. Right-click the process -> Create dump file
5. The .dmp file will be saved to: C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\
6. Copy it to: J:\projects\personal-projects\MemoryAnalysis\samples\

Press Enter to open Task Manager...
